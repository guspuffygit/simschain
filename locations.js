input: Blue velvet is a bar, a piano lounge with a campfire, piano man, dimly lit candles, long bar in the back, small couryard out back.    
The Blue Velvet, nestled amidst the bustling city streets, stood as a sanctuary of refined indulgence.
Its two-story faÃ§ade exuded an air of timeless elegance.
The soulful melodies of a piano cascaded through the air, caressing the ears and soothing the senses.
Guests gathered around the polished grand piano, their faces aglow with the soft flicker of candlelight, engaged in whispered conversations and laughter that mingled harmoniously with the music.
To the left of the piano, a welcoming fireplace crackled with a gentle warmth, casting dancing shadows across the room and bathing the patrons in a cozy, amber embrace.
The back of the bar featured a small, urban oasis.
In the courtyard, a charming fountain adorned the center, its gentle cascade serenading visitors on a weathered stone bench.
Under the starlit canopy, patrons found respite, engaging in tranquil conversations amidst the night's whispers.
A skilled bartender stands behind a polished bar adorned with gleaming bottles, ready to craft soul-igniting or heart-soothing concoctions.
Plush bar stools offer comfort and a front-row seat to the vibrant characters that bring the place to life.`,
